For my first program I wanted to experiment with variables. I found an example, where a line moved across a screen, where a variable was essential part of the process. I studied the syntax for quite long a time, since I had no prior experience with variables. Eventually I was able to replicate the syntax. I found this a bit boring however, so I started to experiment with modifying the code to a different shape. I settled on a circle, that became increasingly smaller.
   Coding has a lot of similarities with writing a normal text: There is lines, a language of sorts with rules (grammar and so on), and a lot of considerations on what and how to express it. There is a difference in the process itself. When I write, I use it as tool for thinking. With programming however, I don’t know enough syntaxes and have enough experience, so that I can code without the need to research syntaxes, functions and examples. I hope, that I will eventually be able to code without the need for research, so that the process becomes more of a thinking tool.
   One of the most important possibilities of coding is, for me, exactly as a tool for thinking. Coding provides a way of expressing ideas – often complex ones. In that sense coding might also be a tool for collaboration, when working on projects.
