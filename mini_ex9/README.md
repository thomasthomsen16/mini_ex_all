### My own flowchart for mini 6

#### Thoughts on the proces

One of the things I found most difficult, and what I expect is the most difficult part of drawing any flowchart, is reducing often complex operations into abstractions, that encompasses all of these. This task can, and was for me, very difficult, since it requires thinking about code and the program in a whole new way. The focus isn’t on the technical specifications for the program in terms of code, but rather the code as a whole and how each different part of the code relates to each other. This requires breaking different parts of the code into boxes of abstractions – a sort of encapsulation.

#### (Individual) Differences between flowchart for mini ex 6 and flowchart for group

One the obvious differences between the two flowcharts is, that the one for mini ex6 was made after finishing the code. The flowchart thereby becomes a visualization of a already existing program and helps myself and other viewers make sense of how to the program is functioning on a conceptually level.
   The flowchart for the exam done with my study group is more of thinking tool. Its role is more to visualize our ideas rather than finished code and can, and probably will, be used to pinpoint critical things about our ideas: Will this work? Were should we pay extra attention, when we code? How should the overall structure of the code be? 
    I find this difference very interesting, since I have never used nor thought of flowcharts as a tool for developing ideas. In that sense, the flowchart also become a tool for collaboration, something visual that we can all point at and reference when coming up new ideas and discussing them.


#### (Individual) Reflections on algorithm and flowchart

Start ud med at snakke om extended mind

-	Algoritmer som ‘the extended mind’: “[…] a framing of cognition that accommodates the many ways in which it spills out of the conscious brain into the body and our surrounding social and technical environments” – s. 37
   o	Konsekvensen af dette: “[…] our interaction with the technology of the written word not only changed the medium of thought, extending it to external papers, scrolls and other material stuff, but it also changed the mode of thought.” – s. 38

-	Algoritmers kulturelle indflydelse, her med eksempel fra staveprogrammer: ”[…] harder to distinguish from broader cultural environments: to what extent are spell-check programs changing diction and grammatical choices through their billions of subtle corrections, and how do we disentangle the assemblage of code, dictionaries, and grammars that underlie them?” – s. 16

Snak herefter om faren ved dette, da algoritmer altid har en vis bias, og de influerer vores tænkning så meget, kan det være kritisk i forhold til, måden vi tænker på (afskærer visse måder at tænke på) og at bestemte firmaer/personer(Facebook, Google osv.) kan påvirke i så stor grad i takt med den stigende digitalisering.

But software engineers construct the datasets mined by scoring systems; they define the parameters of data-mining analyses; they create the clusters, links, and decision trees applied; they generate the predictive models applied. Human biases and values are embedded into each and every step of development. Computerization may simply drive discrimination upstream.” – s. 21
