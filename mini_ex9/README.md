### My own flowchart for mini 6

#### Thoughts on the proces

One of the things I found most difficult, and what I expect is the most difficult part of drawing any flowchart, is reducing often complex operations into abstractions, that encompasses all of these. This task can, and was for me, very difficult, since it requires thinking about code and the program in a whole new way. The focus isn’t on the technical specifications for the program in terms of code, but rather the code as a whole and how each different part of the code relates to each other. This requires breaking different parts of the code into boxes of abstractions – a sort of encapsulation.

#### (Individual) Differences between flowchart for mini ex 6 and flowchart for group

One the obvious differences between the two flowcharts is, that the one for mini ex6 was made after finishing the code. The flowchart thereby becomes a visualization of a already existing program and helps myself and other viewers make sense of how to the program is functioning on a conceptually level.
   The flowchart for the exam done with my study group is more of thinking tool. Its role is more to visualize our ideas rather than finished code and can, and probably will, be used to pinpoint critical things about our ideas: Will this work? Were should we pay extra attention, when we code? How should the overall structure of the code be? 
    I find this difference very interesting, since I have never used nor thought of flowcharts as a tool for developing ideas. In that sense, the flowchart also become a tool for collaboration, something visual that we can all point at and reference when coming up new ideas and discussing them.
