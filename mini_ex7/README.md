### C0MTUT3R L0V3 

By Thomas Thomsen & Sille Kock

*" 'secondary notation,'  a pejorative term suggesting that code ’ s primary purpose is to be executed by a computer, and only secondarily to be understood by a human.”* - Cox, Geoff and McLean, Alex. Speaking Code. MIT Press, 2013. 17-38.

Codes primary objective is, in line with the quote from Cox & McLean, to be executed by a computer and secondarily to be understood by a human. Our work seeks to reserve these roles, to make the code understandeble and poetic for humans and the end result understandeble only for the computer.
   In line with the theme, we have choosen the song and the lyrics from the famous Kraftwerk song "Computer Love", which in itself is a commentary on the rise of computers and technology in everyday life. The song is mechanical in structure repeating lines of lyrics and rhythms back to back - thereby imitating what one expect of computers.
   In our work we have decounstructed the lyrics into functions, variables and if-statements and assembled it into new form pointing back to the songs intial intentions and as commentary on making code understandble for humans by using known structures in p5.js.

#### Analysis: What is the aesthetic aspects of your program in particular to the relationship between code and language?

One of the main points of this work is the deconstruction and reassembling of the lyrics into known structures from the computer world - variables, functions and if statements. The reassembly changes the otherwise non-understandable code, at least for the layman, understandable by imagining code as written text seen books and by reducing the numbers used in the code. This contrast heavily with what one often expects of computer code – something confusing and filled up with symbols and structures unfamiliar for the lay man. As Cox and McLean have put it: 

“*" 'secondary notation,'  a pejorative term suggesting that code ’ s primary purpose is to be executed by a computer, and only secondarily to be understood by a human.”* - Cox, Geoff and McLean, Alex. Speaking Code. MIT Press, 2013. 17-38.

 In changing code into text from natural language this the work changes the structure of the computer language, the semantics, rules, grammar and so on, into more familiar rules and structures seen in natural language making it more understandable and reversing the point Cox and McLean have made in the above quote: Code becomes the part humans understand, while the output is changed to something more understandable by computers – a json file, that contains the lyrics of the shifting before the viewers eyes grouped into nouns, verbs, pronouns and defined words. The lyrics becomes detached from its original meaning, presented only as categories that the computer can use. In doing this, the viewer might gain a deeper understanding of what computer language involves and how it is structured – or as Cox and McLean put it: 

*“[…] "to give voice to those without a voice"* - Cox, Geoff and McLean, Alex. Speaking Code. MIT Press, 2013. 29.

To summarize: The aesthetic qualities for this work lies in making code more understandable by change the structure into that of written text – something that it is more familiar for the layman. One should however be aware of, that much of the logic seen in programing comes from old theory on logic, that incorporates natural language as its primary medium. Thereby programming languages and code inviably builds upon the structures seen in natural language. A layman might have a hard time understanding code and its structure, since it utilizes symbols that isn’t used very often in natural language.
