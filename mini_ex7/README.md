### C0MTUT3R L0V3 

By Thomas Thomsen & Sille Kock

*" 'secondary notation,'  a pejorative term suggesting that code ’ s primary purpose is to be executed by a computer, and only secondarily to be understood by a human.”* - Cox, Geoff and McLean, Alex. Speaking Code. MIT Press, 2013. 17-38.

Codes primary objective is, in line with the quote from Cox & McLean, to be executed by a computer and secondarily to be understood by a human. Our work seeks to reserve these roles, to make the code understandeble and poetic for humans and the end result understandeble only for the computer.
   In line with the theme, we have choosen the song and the lyrics from the famous Kraftwerk song "Computer Love", which in itself is a commentary on the rise of computers and technology in everyday life. The song is mechanical in structure repeating lines of lyrics and rhythms back to back - thereby imitating what one expect of computers.
   In our work we have decounstructed the lyrics into functions, variables and if-statements and assembled it into new form pointing back to the songs intial intentions and as commentary on making code understandble for humans by using known structures in p5.js.
