This program is an evolving piece of artwork made up of intersecting lines, that crosses each other to form new shapes and expressions. The code uses a random() function to constantly change the stroke() of the lines(). The lines are created using a variables to constantly change to x,y for both the starting point and the ending point. The work also uses if()  arguments to control the starting values of the variables in relation to the width and height of the canvas.
    For this piece of work I learned to use if() arguments and how they might influence code and the end result of the code. I wanted to the lines to have random colors, so I looked at a previous work by Mathias, where he used the random() function to change the background color. The last thing I learned in making this work, was the use of function mousePressed(). I used this to reset the canvas to a blank slate when the mouse was pressed.
    For me, my work addresses Goriunova’s notion of fun relation to exploration into the new and unknown. Exploration of new things can often bring a certain element of excitement: What is this new thing, what can it do, how does it work and so on. Exploring the inner mechanics and meanings puts one in a state of pure excitement and one can often forget everything around him – time, place, other daily (often tedious) chores and so. This is the way I felt exploring the new syntaxes and what I could do with them. There possibilities of using variables and if() arguments is endless. It didn’t feel overwhelming – it was more a feeling of utter joy in coming to this revelation.
